<img src="./Figure/paper_picture/Net.jpg" alt="L3FNet Network and Custom Data Flow" style="max-width: 60%;">

## Software Preparation

### Requirement

- PyTorch 1.13.0, torchvision 0.15.0. The code is tested with python=3.8, cuda=11.0.
- A GPU with enough memory

### Datasets

- We used the HCI 4D LF benchmark for training and evaluation. Please refer to the [benchmark website](https://lightfield-analysis.uni-konstanz.de/) for details.

### Train

- Set the hyper-parameters in parse_args() if needed. We have provided our default settings in the realeased codes.
- You can train the network by calling implement.py and giving the mode attribute to train.  
    ``` python ../implement/implement.py --net Net_Full  --n_epochs 3000 --mode train --device cuda:1 ```

- Checkpoint will be saved to ./param/'NetName'.
  
### Valition and Test

- After loading the weight file used by your domain, you can call implement.py and giving the mode attribute to valid or test.
- The result files (i.e., scene_name.pfm) will be saved to ./Results/'NetName'.

## Hardware Preparation

### Hardware Requirement

- ZCU104 platform
- A memory card with PYNQ installed.  
  For details on the initialization of PYNQ on ZCU104, please refer to the Chinese version of the blog "[PYNQ](https://blog.csdn.net/m0_52279000/article/details/129396434?spm=1001.2014.3001.5501)".
- Vivado Tool Kit (vivado, HLS, etc.)
- An Ubuntu with more than 16GB of memory (the Vivado tool is faster when used in Ubuntu)
